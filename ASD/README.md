# Data Structures and Algorithms (ASD)

These are small projects for Data Structures and Algorithms class 
at Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics in the winter 
semester 2015/16.
The tasks are related to some of classic data structures -
such as interval trees, balanced trees, priority queues etc. -
algorithms such as Dijktra's algorithm, topological sorting,
various array sorting alogithms and others - and different
paradigms of problem solving.
